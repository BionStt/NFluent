NFluent backlog
===============

+ Push backlog to github as issues
+ Add a Check.That().ThrowsException<e>(message) method to IFluentAssertion
+ Add a IDateTimeFluentAssertion interface (getting semantic inspiration from: https://github.com/joel-costigliola/fest-joda-time-assert)
+ Decide which behavior to implement for the IInstanceTypeFluentAssertion methods with subtypes (when type is not exactly of )
	+ May be interesting to introduce methods such as IsAssignableTo<T>() and IsNotAssignableTo<T>()
+ Find an offical Software factory
	+ Including SONAR quality analysis
+ Test with different unit testing libraries
	+ via a dedicated sample project like Joel did with FEST assert? (https://github.com/joel-costigliola/fest-examples/tree/master/src/test/java/org/fest/assertions/examples) 
+ Publish v1.0 into nuget
+ Improve FluentException messages
	+ Make every FluentException message a two liners
	+ Improve the output of the FluentException messages when objects are not of the same types but return the same ToString() value. 
+ Add new assertion methods to complete the offer of NFluent
+ Introduce Not operators for the IChainableFluentAssertion interface?
+ Tackle all the TODO comments
+ Spread the word about the library to have feedback and first users
