Temporary backlog
-------

1. Ensure test coverage is 100% (use T4 to generate tests on numbers?)
1. Add some assertion method to the comparable types (e.g. IsAfter()).
1. Expose IComparable extension methods to 'number' values so that autocompletion works on number values with those comparable assertions.
1. Clean up some code within the {x}Extensions files?
1. Ensure test coverage is 100%
