Temporary backlog
-------
1. Add some check methods to the comparable types (e.g. IsAfter()).
1. Expose IComparable extension methods to 'number' values so that autocompletion works on number values with those comparable checks.
1. Adds more unit tests to the FluentMessage so that it will act as a documentation.
1. Review all the FluentMessage and use the "given value(s)" instead of "expected enumerable"? when appropriate.

Done item
-------.
1. Reached 100% coverage on NFluent.dll
1. Improved formatting of type's names
1. Improved signature generation and Documentation related tests
1. Added HasFieldsEqualToThose to compare two objects at the field level
