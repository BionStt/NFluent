Temporary backlog
-------
1. Make the FluentMessage able to write "The given value(s)" instead of "the expected enumerable". 
1. Make the NumberFluentAssertion not implementing the IFluentAssertion anymore.
1. Continue to migrate to the new error message formats (next: ?).
1. Add some assertion method to the comparable types (e.g. IsAfter()).
1. Expose IComparable extension methods to 'number' values so that autocompletion works on number values with those comparable assertions.
