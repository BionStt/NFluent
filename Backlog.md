Temporary backlog
-------
1. Continue to migrate to the new error message formats (next: ContainsTests.cs).
1. Add some assertion method to the comparable types (e.g. IsAfter()).
1. Expose IComparable extension methods to 'number' values so that autocompletion works on number values with those comparable assertions.
