Temporary backlog
-------
1. (Thomas) Finish to replace all the 'The actual date time' by 'The checked date time' + other kind of the date time.
1. (Thomas) review/refactor the FluentMessage implementation with more unit test?

1. Make some FluentMessage able to write "The given value(s)" instead of "the expected enumerable"?
1. Add some check methods to the comparable types (e.g. IsAfter()).
1. Expose IComparable extension methods to 'number' values so that autocompletion works on number values with those comparable checks.

Done item
-------.
1. Reached 100% coverage on NFluent.dll
1. Improved formatting of type's names
1. Improved signature generation and Documentation related tests
1. Added HasFieldsEqualToThose to compare two objects at the field level
