New feature(s):
* Adds IsSetWithin check for EventWaitHandle types (ex. Manual or AutoResetEvent)
* Adds IsOneOfThese() check for string.
* NFluent is now also available as a Portable Class Library (Profile: portable-net4+sl5+wp8+win8+MonoMac+MonoTouch+MonoAndroid)
--------------
Change(s):
* Renames the Properties extension method on IEnumerable to Extracting. Properties is still there, but marked as obsolete.
* Improves error messages for IsInstanceOf checks.
* IsNull, IsNotNull, IsSameReferenceThan, IsDistinctFrom, HasFieldsWithSameValues and HasNotFieldsWithSameValues are now able to conserve the checked typed (instead of loosing it by converting it into a object).
* InheritsFrom does not return a linkable check anymore (but void).
--------------
Bug Fixe(s):
* Fixes a null ref exception for Contains on null
* Fixes a null ref exception for HasFieldsWithSameValues
* Fixes Invalid exceptions on strings with curly braces
