New feature(s):
* Now, supports .NET Tasks and Async methods/lambdas/functions thanks to a new Check.ThatAsyncCode()  statement.
--------------
Change(s):
* Error messages with double and float are now displayed with InvariantCulture.
* Improves error message for IsAfter on null value.
* Check.ThatCode(...).Throws<T>() now requires T to be an exception. This restriction ensures only Exceptions are proposed in autocompletion.
--------------
Bug Fixe(s):
* There was an inversion between expected and actual error message for the .WithMessage checks on execption. This is fixed.
* Fixes an issue with null on Check.That(...).IsBefore(...)
