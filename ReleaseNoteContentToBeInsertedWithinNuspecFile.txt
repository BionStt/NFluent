New feature(s):
* NFluent is now also shipped with its .NET 4.0 version (to support dynamic for extensibility)
* Adds recursion to the HasFieldsEqualToThose() check on object

--------------
Change(s):
* You can now easily link your own checks by using the And operator thanks to the IChecker.ReturnValueForLinkage property (if you don't want to rely on the ExtensibilityHelper class).

--------------
Bug Fixe(s):
* IsAfter() check was throwing an exception when the givenValue type (considered as a IComparable instead of a number ;-(  was not the same as the checked value.
