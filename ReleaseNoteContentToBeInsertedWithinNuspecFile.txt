New feature(s):
* Introduces a mechanism for anyone to easily extend NFluent with his own checks (see. ExtensibilityHelper)
* Adds IsNull() and IsNotNull() checks.
* Enhances the Lambda check experience by supporting checks on Func, allowing writing of some usual tests without braces, and giving the possibility to check message and properties of Exceptions
--------------
Change(s):
* Now, Check.That(4L).IsEqualTo(4) passes instead of throwing that types are differents.
