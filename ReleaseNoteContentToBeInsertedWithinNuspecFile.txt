New features:
* Now, the Equals() method of the ICheck&lt;T&gt; instances is a real fluent check method.
* New extensible syntax for Check.That(IEnumerable xxx).Contains(...) that permits to add suffixes narrowing the conditions (e.g.: Check.That(IEnumerable xxx).Contains(...).InThatOrder()). Possible suffixes are (Only, Once or InThatOrder)
--------------
Changes:
* New error message structure that clearly states what is wrong.
* Renames the ContainsOnly() method to IsOnlyMadeOf()
* Replaces IFluentAssertion by ICheck; and IChainableFluentAssertion by ICheckLink so that it improves the IntelliSense experience.
