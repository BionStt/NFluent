- Adds the Not operator for all assertion methods (except the lambda related ones)
- Covers the Enum types with the Check.ThatEnum() statement (e.g.: Check.ThatEnum(Nationality.French).IsEqualTo(Nationality.French); )
- Hides the 'Value' and 'Negatable' properties from the IntelliSense
- Introduces a new concept of IRunnableAssertion and IFluentAssertionRunner for everyone that need to add new assertion methods (improvements to come for those like us that write assertion methods).
